## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze air quality data to assess 
the levels and trends of various pollutants such as CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, 
PM10, and NH₃ over time. By examining the data, we aim to uncover patterns, 
understand the relationship between different pollutants, and identify any 
anomalies or extreme values. This analysis will provide insights that could be 
valuable for evaluating air quality, understanding pollution dynamics, and 
supporting environmental decision-making.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, 
which hosts various open-source datasets. This specific dataset contains 
information on air pollutant levels, including concentrations of CO, NO, NO₂, 
O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, PM10, and NH₃, recorded over multiple dates.
