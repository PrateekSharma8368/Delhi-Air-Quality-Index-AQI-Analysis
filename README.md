# Delhi-Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Analysis
This project aims to analyze air quality data to assess  the levels and trends of various pollutants such as CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5,  PM10, and NH₃ over time. By examining the data, we aim to uncover patterns,  understand the relationship between different pollutants, and identify any  anomalies or extreme values.
